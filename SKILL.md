# baton

Turn a piece of work — or a document about work not yet done — into one
self-contained HTML page: diagrams the reader walks in minutes, with the
**complete context** embedded so the reader's own coding agent — Claude Code,
Codex, Cursor, anything — picks up where you are and keeps answering.

`references/pipeline.md` is the whole build. This file is the two decisions
that shape it, and the rules that differ by decision.

## First decide two things — from the evidence, never by asking

**1. What is the input?**

- **Done work.** This session, a branch, commits, a bugfix, an investigation,
  an incident; "pack this up", "where are we", "I'm stopping here",
  總結這幾個 commit. A repo is not required — a debugging afternoon with no
  branch packs as well as a merged feature; never refuse for want of a repo.
- **A document about work not yet done.** A PRD, spec, RFC, design proposal,
  decision doc, 需求文档/设计文档/決策文件 — pasted inline, attached, or named
  by path or URL. Tell-tales: user stories, acceptance criteria, options under
  consideration, "we should/will build", no commits or session work
  corresponding to it.

**2. Who reads the page?**

- **An engineer** — future you, or a colleague inheriting the branch. One who
  has forgotten, not one who was never told. Register `engineer`:
  identifiers, paths and code stay.
- **Someone who does not read code** — "for my PM", "report upward",
  "explain to the boss", 向上報告, an executive, director or non-technical
  audience named or implied. Not stupid, not lazy — no context, very little
  time, and one question: **what can now go wrong for our users?** Change is
  your unit; risk is theirs. Register `eli5`.

Tie-breakers:

- Done work with no audience stated → engineer. The `eli5` register requires
  an explicitly non-technical reader.
- A document whose content the repo or session shows is **already
  implemented** is not a proposal any more: treat it as done work and say so
  on the page — proposal framing would mislead.
- Mixed input — a spec plus a session that partially implemented it — routes
  by the deliverable asked for: "visualise / align on the plan" → document;
  "where did we get to" → done work.
- For a document, the register follows whoever the document is for: a PRD
  read by a PM takes `eli5`, an RFC among engineers takes `engineer`. Keep
  the mechanism's proper nouns either way — a decision about EIP-712 is not
  a decision about "signing".

Announce the choice in one short line (e.g. "baton — 已完成的 commit 總結，
讀者是工程師"), then build. Ask only when the input is a genuine stub — a
title and a few bullets — and then about the missing content, never about
which route.

## Rules that hold on every route

**Always diagrams.** If the source carries diagrams, reuse their structure;
if it does not, draw from the code or the document and say the drawing is
your reading of it. The one thing never to ship is no diagram at all — a
page of prose is the thing this format replaces.

**Per-item drawings.** When the ask — or the document — enumerates items
(each commit, each fix, each workstream, each requirement, each decision),
every item gets its own small figure, not a prose list entry (pipeline §3,
per-item rule). For a bugfix or fix series: one `vuln` card **per fix**, each
with its own before/after severed-chain diagram, the fix's `file:line` in
`ref`, and the mechanism named in the fix text (`diagrams.md` § Per-fix
before / after). Generate the set from one layout function, never free-draw
them one by one. A status page that never shows what was actually fixed
reads as if nothing was.

**Do not guess.** The reader cannot tell your inferences from your facts, so
do not mix them. Deployment state — whether a migration ran, whether users
see anything today — is not in the repository. When there is no PR, or `gh`
cannot reach the forge, say nothing about tests or reviews. "Not recorded
here — ask" is a complete answer; a guess spends trust you cannot get back.

**The context is complete.** Three layers (pipeline §2): the record, your
own compaction, and how to pull more. Build it before the page, which is only
a view of it. A context that could be regenerated from `git log` has failed.

## If the input is done work: what only the session knows

The compaction's *paths taken and abandoned*. A diff shows the approach that
survived; only the session knows the three that were tried and reverted and
why they died — the ruled-out auth gateway, the rejected storage approach,
the state removed on product grounds and the unverified assumption that
removal rests on. That is what a closing session throws away, and recovering
it is why this skill exists. Write every workstream — you lived it.

For a past session you were not part of, read the transcript JSONL under
`~/.claude/projects/<slug>/` selectively — the user turns and the failed
commands, filtered with a short inline command, not the whole stream; the
deliverable is still all three layers.

## If the input is a document: a proposal is not behaviour

The reader cannot tell your diagram of an intended flow from a diagram of a
shipped one, and if they confuse the two they will plan against something
that does not exist. So:

- The subtitle, the footer and the context's first line all say **proposal**
- `layer` is `proposal`, never `L0`/`L1`
- Where implementation *does* exist, say which parts — and say what is
  inferred where it does not

**Read the document and decide what it is.** The kind decides the diagrams:

| what you find | the shape it wants |
|---|---|
| user stories, acceptance criteria, flows | the **user journey** as a flowchart; the fiddliest acceptance rule as a **decision tree** |
| a decision with rejected alternatives | **rejected vs recommended**, side by side — the alternatives are the argument |
| several competing options weighed against each other | the full **comparison treatment** (`diagrams.md`): a decision matrix on the separating questions, one mechanism drawing per option, and paired what-it-buys / what-it-costs panels |
| a risk register | the top risks as **attack paths**, entry → impact, with the control that cuts each |
| scope and non-goals | **in / out** panels; a non-goal is a decision, not an omission |
| API or data contracts | a **sequence** for the exchange, a **state machine** if it has a lifecycle |
| open questions | a list at the end, ranked by what blocks the most work |

Most documents want three or four of these, not all. A section whose source
paragraph is thin should not become a diagram.

**Then check it against the code.** Search for the feature's nouns, look for
the routes and modules it names. Two outcomes, both worth saying plainly:

- **Nothing exists yet.** Every diagram is the proposal. Say so once, clearly.
- **Some of it exists.** Mark which parts have code behind them and which do
  not, and flag anywhere the document contradicts what the code already does —
  that contradiction is the most valuable thing on the page, and only this
  route can find it.

**The context carries the document whole.** Do not summarise it into the
packet — the diagrams are the summary; the context is the source. Then your
own reading of it (what it decides, what it leaves open, what it contradicts),
then how to pull more: the specs it cites, the code that would implement it.

## Order of work

1. **Ground truth** — pipeline §1. Done work: the session first, then git,
   the pull request, the design docs and the migrations *if they exist* —
   each an enhancement, none a prerequisite. Document: read it, classify it
   by the table above, then check it against the code.
2. **Context** — pipeline §2, all three layers, before the page.
3. **Wording** — `eli5` register only: invoke the `eli5` skill, audience
   Product Manager (Director for an executive), and hand it your compaction
   and the extracted facts. `engineer` register: skip `eli5` unless the
   wording needs sharpening.
4. **Page** — `render.py` fills baton's template (scroll / one-pager); spec
   shape in `references/spec.md`. Lean. Typical sections, each dropped if its
   source is empty:
   - *What this is* — one paragraph a person could repeat
   - *What talks to what* — the design doc's architecture diagram, adapted;
     drawn from the code and labelled as inferred when there is none
   - *The change itself* — per-item cards and figures (rule above)
   - *The order's life* — the state machine, each transition openable to its
     one database transaction — full set, never a subset (`diagrams.md`)
   - *One payment, in order* — the sequence diagram, real loops and
     fallbacks kept, labels reworded for the reader
   - *Roads not taken* and *next steps* — the abandoned paths, from the
     session
   - *What to watch* — risks only, each traceable; an empty list is a
     finding, an invented one is a lie
   - Document route: the shapes from the table, with in / out panels and the
     open questions last
5. **Verify** — `verify.py --register <engineer|eli5>`; fix by finding a real
   word, never by deleting the sentence. Then the real-browser check, pipeline
   §6 — non-skippable; a packet once shipped on script checks alone was
   completely broken.
6. **Publish** — `Artifact` if a URL is wanted; otherwise the file beside the
   work is the deliverable.

## When not to run

Say so plainly instead of shipping a hollow packet:

- No transcript and no session context — there is nothing to compact, and
  `git log` in costume is worse than saying so.
- The session did no substantive work (nothing to compact but metadata), or
  the change has no reader-facing consequence at all.
- The document is a stub — a title and a few bullets. A page of diagrams
  drawn from three sentences invents structure the author never committed to.
